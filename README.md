# Serpent Anticheat by demonpvp

Serpent is a minecraft anticheat base that supports versions from 1.7 to 1.19

The base uses PacketEvents 2.0 as a dependency, and is used for retriving or sending packets with minimal performance issues.

Currently the anticheat is using 1.8.8 spigot, if you would like to change this for another version, you can modify it in the 'pom.xml'
